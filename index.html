			<div class="system"> On the Directions page, my application asks you to enter a start and beginning address or location, your route type (fastest, shortest, eco, or thrilling).  If you pick thrilling, you can enter your hilliness you want, otherwise disregard it. Finally, enter your mode of travel (car, van, bike, etc) and press submit! Below in the directions panel you'll see the total time, distance, and any traffic.  Below that is each direction accompanied by a map picture.  Enjoy!
